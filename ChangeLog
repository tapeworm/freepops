- fixed debian package, the graphical updater is in a separate package to not require X for the simple daemon. Added and entry in the menu system using su-to-root for the updater with fltk 
- added freepops-updater-dialog that provides a textual interface to the updater

- fixed luabox to use package.preload and require for C modules 'statically' linked 
- addded the special 'fltk' backend that starts the fltk gui (since there is
no lua binding for fltk, the main has to be in C and calls lua funtions when
needed, as the dialog frontend does, but not calling them internally since the
C main is a .so the is loaded by freepops and the run() function is called,
and thus all the updater lua API can be accessed directly)
- completely reorganized the updater code: updater_(cvs|php).lua are the two backends that provide the same interface, updater_common.lua provides some common helpers for both backends and the mangler for using the backends from the command line and the documentation, updater.lua is now in src/lua/ as all plugins and uses the cvs backend and provides a minimal main() that allows to call the backends from the command line and receiving their output mangled by updater_common.  - added documentation for the -n switch
