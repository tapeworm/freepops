FreePOPs

To install, edit by hand config.h for tuning the build if necessary and then 
type:

 ./configure.sh <system>
 make <target>
 
Available systems:
  linux		- to compile on a linux host
  osx		- to compile on a darwin host
  obsd		- to compile on an OpenBSD host
  fbsd		- to compile on an FreeBSD host
  beos		- to compile on a beos host
  cygwin	- to compile on a cygwin environment
  win		- to cross-compile for win on a linux host with mingw32msvc
	
Valid targets are:
  all		- build it (remember to ./configure.sh first)
  clean		- clean the source tree
  distclean	- remove also the dist-* distributions
  realclean	- clean and be ready for building to another arch
  doc		- create developers documentation
  install	- install it (linux/unix - distribution independent)
  uninstall	- uninstall it (linux/unix - distribution independent)
  buildfactory	- build all distributions

Default is all.

If you prefer to build a package for only one distribution instead of using the 
buildfactory target, you may do 'cd buildfactory' and launch

 make <target>
 
Valid targets in this case are:
  dist-win	- Windows .exe
  dist-deb	- Debian GNU/Linux .deb
  dist-rpm	- Red Hat Linux .rpm
  dist-gen	- Gentoo Linux .ebuild
  dist-tgz	- Source .tgz
  dist-obsd	- 

Enjoy!
