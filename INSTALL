Compilation and installation
----------------------------

To complile and install FreePOPs, use these commands:

 ./configure.sh <system>
 make <target>
 
Available systems:
  linux        - to compile on a linux host and install in /usr/local
                 using openssl libraries
  linux-gnutls - to compile on a linux host and install in /usr/local
                 using gnutls libraries instead of openssl
  linux-slack  - to compile on a linux host and install in /usr
  osx          - to compile on a darwin host
  obsd         - to compile on an OpenBSD host
  fbsd         - to compile on an FreeBSD host
  beos         - to compile on a beos host
  cygwin       - to compile on a cygwin environment
  win          - to cross-compile for win on a linux host with mingw32msvc
                 using openssl libraries
  win-gnutls   - to cross-compile for win on a linux host with mingw32msvc
                 using gnutls libraries instead of openssl
	
Valid targets are:
  all		- build it (remember to ./configure.sh first)
  clean		- clean the source tree
  distclean	- remove also the dist-* distributions
  realclean	- clean and be ready for building to another arch
  doc		- create developers documentation
  install	- install it (linux/unix - distribution independent)
  uninstall	- uninstall it (linux/unix - distribution independent)
  buildfactory	- build all distributions
Default target is all.

If you want to modify some parameters of FreePOPs, edit by hand the file
config.h


Build packages
--------------

If you prefer to build a package for only one distribution instead of using the 
buildfactory target, you may do 'cd buildfactory' and launch

 make <target>
 
Valid targets in this case are:
  dist-win	- Windows .exe setup
  dist-deb	- Debian GNU/Linux .deb .changes .dsc .orig.tar.gz .diff.gz
  dist-deb-woody
  dist-deb-sarge
  dist-deb-etch
  dist-deb-sid
  debian-dsc	- Debian GNU/Linux .dsc .orig.tar.gz .diff.gz
  debian-dsc-woody
  debian-dsc-sarge
  debian-dsc-etch
  debian-dsc-sid
  dist-rpm	- Red Hat Linux .rpm
  dist-gen	- Gentoo Linux .ebuild
  dist-slack	- Slackware .tgz
  dist-tgz	- Source .tar.gz
  dist-obsd	- OpenBSD
  dist-osx	- Mac OS X 10.3 and above
  dist-osx-static	- Mac OS X 10.2 (static package)

Enjoy!

note: on some systems you should use gmake instead of make.
