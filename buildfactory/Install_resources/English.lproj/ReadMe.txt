FreePOPs Readme file


This package contains the pre-compiled distribution of FreePOPs for Mac OS X systems. In order to use it, run a Terminal, move to the directory you've installed FreePOPs into then run ./freepopsd, with your favorite command line options. See freepopsd -h or the manuals included in the doc/ directory for a complete list of command line options.
In case you have problems updating from an older version, delete manually the directory you've installed FreePOPs into as well as the /Library/Receipts/FreePOPs-x.y.z.pkg file (x.y.z is the version of FreePOPs currently installed).

LiberoPOPs users might find the included LP-to-FP migration howto useful.

Please remember to generate a verbose log with the '-w -l log.txt' options if you need to ask the developers for help or report a bug.
To ask for help, AFTER you've read the included documentation, you may look at:
