getdate/

  Taken from curl-7.11.0 is under this public domain license:
  
  Originally written by Steven M. Bellovin <smb@research.att.com> while
  at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Later tweaked by
  a couple of people on Usenet.  Completely overhauled by Rich $alz
  <rsalz@bbn.com> and Jim Berets <jberets@bbn.com> in August, 1990.
  
  This code has been modified since it was included in curl, to make it
  thread-safe and to make compilers complain less about it.
  
  This code is in the public domain and has no copyright.
