#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"FreePOPs can be launched in a chrooted environment to improve security. The "
"jail will be created in /var/lib/freepops/chroot-jail/. This will also "
"create a start.sh script in the root of the jail that should be used to "
"launch freepopsd. This is perfectly integrated with the init script, so you "
"have to change nothing to automatically start freepopsd at boot. This "
"feature is mostly untested, you are warned."
