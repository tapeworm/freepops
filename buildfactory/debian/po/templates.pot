"FreePOPs can be launched in a chrooted environment to improve security. The "
"jail will be created in /var/lib/freepops/chroot-jail/. This will also "
"create a start.sh script in the root of the jail that should be used to "
"launch freepopsd. This is perfectly integrated with the init script, so you "
"have to change nothing to automatically start freepopsd at boot. This "
"feature is mostly untested, you are warned."

"freepops-updater-fltk or freepops-updater-dialog can install local updates "
"in  /var/lib/freepops/lua_updates. These updates are usually integrated in "
"the next freepops release or can be downloaded again running the updater, so "
"they can be safely removed.  Modules placed in /var/lib/freepops/lua_updates "
"have higher priority than the ones in /usr/share/freepops/lua; if you don't "
"remove them you may end up running outdated modules. Anyway the system "
"administrator may use this mechanism to freeze some local  modifications "
"with respect to FreePOPs updates."
