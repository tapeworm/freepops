FreePOPs Readme file

This package contains the pre-compiled distribution of FreePOPs for Mac OS X systems. To use it you should just have to install it and double click on it; this will start FreePOPs in the background (the program icon will NOT stay in the Dock), to stop it you will only need to double click on it again. If you want FreePOPs to start automatically at each system boot, you will just have to add it to the list of startup items in your Mac OS X account preferences.

In case you have problems updating from an older version, drag manually the application to the trash as well as the /Library/Receipts/FreePOPs-x.y.z.pkg file (x.y.z is the version of FreePOPs currently installed).

LiberoPOPs users might find the included LP-to-FP migration howto useful.

Please remember to generate a verbose log with the '-w -l log.txt' options if you need to ask the developers for help or report a bug.
