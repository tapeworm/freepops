*Terms of Service*

1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

Welcome to Yahoo!. Yahoo! provides its service to you, subject to the
following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time
to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version
of the TOS at any time at: http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/. In
addition, when using particular Yahoo! owned or operated services, you
and Yahoo! shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable
to such services which may be posted from time to time. All such
guidelines or rules (including but not limited to our Spam Policy
<http://docs.yahoo.com/info/guidelines/spam.html>) are hereby
incorporated by reference into the TOS. Yahoo! may also offer other
services that are governed by different Terms of Service. For instance,
different terms apply to homesteaders on Yahoo! GeoCities
<http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/geoterms.html>, members of Yahoo! Plus
<http://plus.yahoo.com/terms/>, or members of SBC Yahoo! Dial or SBC
Yahoo! DSL <http://sbc.yahoo.com/terms/>.

2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

Yahoo! currently provides users with access to a rich collection of
resources, including, various communications tools, forums, shopping
services, search services, personalized content and branded programming
through its network of properties (the "Service"). You also understand
and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these
advertisements are necessary for Yahoo! to provide the Service. You also
understand and agree that the service may include certain communications
from Yahoo!, such as service announcements, administrative messages and
the Yahoo! Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part
of Yahoo! membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving
them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment
or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Yahoo!
properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that
the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that Yahoo! assumes no
responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to
store any user communications or personalization settings. You are
responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access may
involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime
charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees
associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition,
you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to
access the Service.

Please be aware that Yahoo! has created certain areas on the Service
that contain adult or mature content. You must be at least 18 years of
age to access and view such areas.

3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS

In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are
of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from
receiving services under the laws of the United States or other
applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate,
current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the
Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration
Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to
keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any
information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or
Yahoo! has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is
untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Yahoo! has the right to
suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or
future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). Yahoo! is concerned
about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children.
For this reason, parents of children under the age of 13 who wish to
allow their children access to the Service must create a Yahoo! Family
Account. When you create a Yahoo! Family Account and add your child to
the account, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and that you
are the legal guardian of the child/children listed on the Yahoo! Family
Account. By adding a child to your Yahoo! Family Account, you also give
your child permission to access all of the Services including, email,
message boards, instant messages and chat (among others). Please
remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience.
Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to
determine whether any of the Services and/or Content (as defined in
Section 6 below) are appropriate for your child.

4. YAHOO! PRIVACY POLICY

Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to
our Privacy Policy. For more information, see our full privacy policy at
http://privacy.yahoo.com/, or if you came from Yahooligans!, then see
our Yahooligans! privacy policy at http://www.yahooligans.com/docs/privacy/.

5. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY

You will receive a password and account designation upon completing the
Service's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible
for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree
to (a) immediately notify Yahoo! of any unauthorized use of your
password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that
you exit from your account at the end of each session. Yahoo! cannot and
will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to
comply with this Section 5.

6. MEMBER CONDUCT

photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content"),

      learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under
      nondisclosure agreements);

      Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret,

      shopping rooms) that are designated for such purpose (please read
      our complete Spam Policy
      <http://docs.yahoo.com/info/guidelines/spam.html>);
   8. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any
      material that contains software viruses or any other computer
      code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit
      the functionality of any computer software or hardware or
      telecommunications equipment;
   9. disrupt the normal flow of dialogue, cause a screen to "scroll"
      faster than other users of the Service are able to type, or
      otherwise act in a manner that negatively affects other users'
      ability to engage in real time exchanges;
  10. interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks
      connected to the Service, or disobey any requirements, procedures,
      policies or regulations of networks connected to the Service;

      to, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
      Commission, any rules of any national or other securities
      exchange, including, without limitation, the New York Stock
      Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, and any
      regulations having the force of law;
  12. "stalk" or otherwise harass another; or
  13. collect or store personal data about other users.

You acknowledge that Yahoo! may or may not pre-screen Content, but that
Yahoo! and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation)
in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or move any Content that
is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Yahoo! and
its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates
the TOS or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate,
and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including
any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such
Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any
Content created by Yahoo! or submitted to Yahoo, including without
limitation information in Yahoo! Message Boards, and in all other parts
of the Service.

You acknowledge, consent and agree that Yahoo! may access, preserve, and
disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by
law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or
disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process;
(b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the
rights of third-parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer
service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
Yahoo!, its users and the public.

You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the
Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over
various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical
requirements of connecting networks or devices.

You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service
may include security components that permit digital materials to be
protected, and use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by
Yahoo! and/or content providers who provide content to the Service. You
may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules
embedded into the Service. Any unauthorized reproduction, publication,
further distribution or public exhibition of the materials provided on
the Service, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.

7. SPECIAL ADMONITIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL USE

Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with
all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content.
Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the
transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the
country in which you reside.

8. CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON THE SERVICE

Yahoo! does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available

      purposes of providing and promoting the specific Yahoo! Group to
      which such Content was submitted or made available. This license
      exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such
      Content on the Service and will terminate at the time you remove
      or Yahoo! removes such Content from the Service.

      removes such Content from the Service.

      perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part)
      and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or
      medium now known or later developed.

"Publicly accessible" areas of the Service are those areas of the Yahoo!

25. GENERAL INFORMATION

/Entire Agreement./ The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you
and Yahoo! and govern your use of the Service, superceding any prior
agreements between you and Yahoo!. You also may be subject to additional
terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain
other Yahoo! services, affiliate services, third-party content or
third-party software.

/Choice of Law and Forum./ The TOS and the relationship between you and
Yahoo! shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without
regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Yahoo! agree to submit
to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within
the county of Santa Clara, California.

/Waiver and Severability of Terms./ The failure of Yahoo! to exercise or
enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver
of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless
agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'
intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of
the TOS remain in full force and effect.

/No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability./ You agree that your
Yahoo! account is non-transferable and any rights to your Yahoo! I.D. or
contents within your account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of
a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated and all
contents therein permanently deleted.

/Statute of Limitations./ You agree that regardless of any statute or
law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or
related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1)
year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal
or contractual effect.
